My Next.js portfolio website, running on Vercel. I'm parting with IPFS because it's too expensive to keep a responsive page there, although my original ultralight IPFS site will continue running.

## Next Steps:

- Nlp_ipynb and course completion; JupyterLite
- anki decks shareable
- Add papers whose tech I've contributed to

## Linting & Formatting

- **ESLint**: See `eslint.config.mjs`, extending `next/core-web-vitals` checking for Next.js errors and style issues.
- **Prettier**: See `.prettierrc.json`, handles automatic code formatting. Integrated with ESLint via `eslint-config-prettier` to avoid conflicting rules.
- **Automation**: `husky` and `lint-staged` automatically run a pre-commit lint and format of staged files.
- **Available Scripts:**
- `yarn dev`: Runs next dev, starting the local server
- `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint to check for issues across the project.
- `yarn format`: Runs Prettier to automatically format all project files.

## Key Learnings from Recent Development (MDX, Theming, Layouts)

1. **Date Sorting Implementation:**
   -When implementing date-sorting for posts:

   - Direct string comparison with `localeCompare()` is more reliable than creating new Date objects for ISO 8601 formatted dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Complex date parsing can lead to TypeScript construct signature errors and unnecessary type assertions

2. **Using React Components in MDX:**

   - When using `next-mdx-remote` (or similar libraries) to render MDX pages dynamically (e.g., for blog posts under `/resources/[slug].tsx`), components imported _inside_ the `.mdx` file must also be explicitly passed to the `<MDXRemote />` component via its `components` prop in the page rendering file (`[slug].tsx`).

3. **CSS Modules and Theming (`next-themes`):**
   **\* Attempting to define global theme styles using `:root` or attribute selectors like `[data-theme='dark']` directly within a **CSS Module\*\* file (e.g., `utils.module.css`) will cause build errors. CSS Modules expect locally scoped class names or `:global(...)` syntax for non-scoped rules.S

   - For theme switching integrated with `next-themes`, the effective pattern is to define **theme-specific classes** within the CSS Module (e.g., `.dropdownLight`, `.dropdownDark`).
   - React components should then use the `useTheme` hook from `next-themes` to get the current theme (`'light'` or `'dark'`) and conditionally apply the corresponding theme classes alongside base structural classes (e.g., `className={\`\${styles.dropdown} \${isDarkMode ? styles.dropdownDark : styles.dropdownLight}\`}`).

4. **Tailwind CSS and Next.js Integration:**

   - If Tailwind utility classes are present in the rendered HTML (verified via browser inspector) but the corresponding CSS rules are not being applied (styles don't appear in the computed styles), it often indicates an issue with Tailwind's CSS generation process.
   - Ensure the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` correctly includes paths to all files where Tailwind classes are used (e.g., `./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`, `./sections/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`).
   - Verify that `styles/global.css` (or your main CSS entry point imported in `_app.tsx`) contains the `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;` directives.
   - Modern Next.js versions (10+) generally handle Tailwind integration seamlessly _without_ requiring a separate `postcss.config.js` file, provided `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` are installed. Adding an explicit `postcss.config.js` can conflict with Next.js's built-in PostCSS setup. If encountering issues, try removing `postcss.config.js` and restarting the development server.

5. **Opioid Converter Integration & Mobile Refinement:**
   - Integrated the standalone `OpioidConverter` by creating `/opioid-converter` with a custom `OpioidConverterLayout` (bypassing the default layout via `Page.getLayout` and `_app.tsx` checking `Component.getLayout`; required exporting `NextPageWithLayout`). Refactored the component to use React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`) and styled with CSS Modules (using `clamp()` for responsive sizing).
   - Extensive mobile refinement for the data-dense table was required beyond standard responsive techniques, involving adjustments to CSS Grid (`grid-template-columns`), input `min-width`, header text wrapping (`white-space: normal`), and element `gap`.
