# Co-Operability

A dynamic personal website built with Next.js, running on Vercel. I'm parting with IPFS because it's too expensive to keep a responsive page there, although my original ultralight IPFS site will continue running.

### Date Sorting Implementation
When implementing date-based sorting for posts, we discovered that simpler is better:
- Direct string comparison with `localeCompare()` is more reliable than creating new Date objects
- For ISO 8601 formatted dates (YYYY-MM-DD), string comparison works perfectly for chronological sorting
- Complex date parsing can lead to TypeScript construct signature errors and unnecessary type assertions
