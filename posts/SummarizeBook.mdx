**Summarize Book (best with self-help, advice, or knowledge-based books)**
<br />
I have uploaded [XY Author]‚Äôs [XY Text]. I need an extracted summary from you containing all actionable advice/knowledge within this text. 
I will never read the source text, but I want to enjoy 100% of the academic, social, and experiential benefits the text confers. 
Preserve the tone of the original work as much as possible; do not impose your own tone of any kind.
At the end of your output, estimate the time required for a human to 1)read the book, 2)take notes on it and 3)complete any actionable projects within WITHOUT chatGPT and WITH chatGPT.  
Your output should be in markdown, which should be readable by Anki, GitHub, Next.js posts, etc. Format should be maximally universal where possible. 
The following are tags for the summary:
<br />
**PS** = Paraphrased Summary by LLM
<br />
**DQ**  = Direct Quotes, VERBATIM excerpts WITH PAGE NUMBER
<br />
**CS/IE** = Case Study or Illustrative Example: a story or narrative the text provides which is intended to evidence a certain argument or point therein. These should typically be paraphrased and marked with a page number for further investigation, but occasionally there are **CS/IE**s which can be entirely contained in a DQ of a few sentences. In these cases DQ is preferable.
<br />
Your summary should have the following 4-part structure:
<br />
- **Five-paragraph overall summary (PS)**
    -- 1 paragraph: intro + roadmap, structure of the text and arguments
    -- 3 paragraphs: three major movements from the work demonstrating its segues between major arguments, & important subpoints in each argument
    -- conclusion, distilled review of overall argument
- **Ten central case studies (CS/IE)s. (PS)**
    -- Include less than five sentences per **CS/IE** explaining its structure/narrative, showing context in the work, and highlight whether it‚Äôs referenced multiple times.
    -- Connect CS/IEs to actionable advice by subpoint if possible
- **Ten bottom-line pieces of concise, actionable advice (DQ preffered, PS ok)**
    -- whether through author‚Äôs direct recommendation or implicit illustration e.g. ‚Äúsuccessful/unsuccessful examples have typically included THIS course of action: ‚Ä¶‚Äù
    -- Include sub-bullet **CS/IE** here WHENEVER available
<br />
- **Ten of the book‚Äôs best quotes (DQ), selected on the criteria**:
    -- 1. communicates a central point of the text concisely
    -- 2. is dramatic, well-written and/or memorable
    -- 3. illustrates author‚Äôs unique perspective/experience well
<br />
A few final ABSOLUTE RULES:
    1. CLEARLY mark what is (**DQ),** (**PS) and (CS/IE[either DQ or PS])** for all bullet points of the summary so as to make the summary properly attributable.
    <br />
    2. If uncertain about any part of the reduction/summarization process, ask me about specific implementations instead of assuming any particular behavior. This includes what content/themes/chapters to focus the summary on.
    <br />
    3. Points which are already too nuanced/concise to be effectively summarized should be marked with page numbers so that I can peruse the book.
    <br />
    4. After you complete this first response, give a few options for drilldown prompts which would allow me to further investigate the depth of the text using your (the LLM‚Äôs) help.
