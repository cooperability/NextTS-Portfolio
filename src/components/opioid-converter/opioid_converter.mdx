# Opioid Calculator

A medical tool for converting between different opioid medications, calculating
morphine equivalence, and determining appropriate methadone conversions.

## Features

- Real-time conversion between multiple opioid medications
- Automatic calculation of morphine and methadone equivalence
- Increment/decrement buttons for precise dosage adjustments
- Clear all functionality for quick resets
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functionality

- Built using React and TypeScript
- Implements controlled form inputs for precise dosage management
- Uses mathematical models for accurate opioid conversions
- Includes special handling for methadone's non-linear conversion

### Mobile Enhancements

1. **Responsive Layout**

   - Adjusted padding and margins for smaller screens
   - Implemented flexible column layouts for narrow viewports
   - Optimized button and input sizes for touch interactions

2. **Typography**
