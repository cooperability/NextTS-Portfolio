# Opioid Calculator

A medical tool for converting between different opioid medications, calculating morphine equivalence, and determining appropriate methadone conversions.

## Features

- Real-time conversion between multiple opioid medications
- Automatic calculation of morphine and methadone equivalence
- Increment/decrement buttons for precise dosage adjustments
- Clear all functionality for quick resets
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functionality
- Built using React and TypeScript
- Implements controlled form inputs for precise dosage management
- Uses mathematical models for accurate opioid conversions
- Includes special handling for methadone's non-linear conversion

### Mobile Enhancements
1. **Responsive Layout**
   - Adjusted padding and margins for smaller screens
   - Implemented flexible column layouts for narrow viewports
   - Optimized button and input sizes for touch interactions

2. **Typography**
   - Used clamp() for fluid typography scaling
   - Increased touch target sizes for better accessibility
   - Adjusted font sizes to maintain readability on small screens

3. **Input Handling**
   - Set explicit font-size to prevent iOS zoom on focus
   - Optimized input padding for mobile keyboards
   - Enhanced touch targets for increment/decrement buttons

4. **Performance**
   - Implemented efficient state management
   - Optimized re-renders using useCallback
   - Maintained smooth animations on mobile devices

## Usage

The calculator allows healthcare providers to:
1. Enter daily doses for various opioid medications
2. Use +/- buttons for precise adjustments
3. View real-time morphine and methadone equivalence
4. Clear all values with a single click

## Safety Note

This tool is intended for use by healthcare professionals only. All conversions should be verified against current clinical guidelines.
