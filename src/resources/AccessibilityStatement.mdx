  My commitment to accessibility and information about Co-Operability.com's
  conformance.
---
I'm committed to making this website accessible to everyone. Rather than just
checking boxes, I've built accessibility into my development process from the
ground up—using semantic HTML, ensuring keyboard navigation works throughout the
site, and testing with both automated tools and manual checks. My goal is to
meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, and I've integrated accessibility testing directly
into my development workflow.

The site works across screen readers, supports both light and dark themes with
proper contrast ratios, and maintains a logical structure that makes sense
whether you're navigating visually or with assistive technology. I regularly
audit the site using ESLint accessibility rules, axe-core testing, and
Lighthouse audits—the detailed reports are saved in my project for ongoing
improvement.

**What I've implemented:**

- Semantic HTML5 structure and logical heading hierarchy
- Full keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes for enhanced screen reader experience
- Responsive design tested across devices and screen sizes
- Sufficient color contrast in both light and dark themes
- Automated testing suite (ESLint jsx-a11y, axe-core, Lighthouse)
- Manual testing including browser accessibility inspection tools

I welcome feedback on accessibility—please reach out if you encounter any
barriers. Accessibility is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time checkbox.
