# Accessibility Statement for Co-Operability.com

**Last Updated: 2025-05-16**

Co-Operability.com is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people
with disabilities. I am continually improving the user experience for everyone
and applying the relevant accessibility standards. My goal is to conform with
the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA**.

## My Approach to Accessibility

I believe accessibility is an ongoing effort and have integrated the following
practices:

- **Semantic HTML**: I strive to use correct HTML5 elements to ensure a good
  structural baseline.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are intended to be navigable
  and operable via keyboard.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Where appropriate, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet
  Applications) attributes are used to enhance the user experience for assistive
  technologies. For example, navigation regions are labeled for clarity.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to be responsive and usable across
  various screen sizes and devices.
- **Color Contrast**: I aim for sufficient color contrast for text and
  interactive elements in both light and dark themes.
- **Automated Testing**: I utilize a suite of tools to help identify potential
  issues:
  - `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`: For static analysis of React components during
    development.
  - `axe-core`: Run via CLI to test against WCAG standards.
  - `Lighthouse`: For broader accessibility, performance, and best practices
    audits.
  - These automated checks are bundled into a `yarn access` command within my
    project.
- **Manual Testing**: I supplement automated tests with manual checks, including
  using browser-based accessibility inspection tools (like Axe DevTools) and
  testing keyboard navigation.

## Current Conformance Status & Findings

Based on my latest assessments (as of the "Last Updated" date):

- **Language Identification**: The primary language of the site is correctly
  identified as English (`lang="en"`).
- **Page Titles**: Each page should have a descriptive title for browser tabs
  and assistive technology. (Ongoing review)
- **Headings**: I aim for a logical heading structure on each page, including a
  unique main heading (H1). (Ongoing review)
- **Color Contrast**:
  - Manual testing with browser developer tools (Axe DevTools) indicates that
    text elements, including links, generally meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
    in both light and dark themes, due to my theming system (`next-themes`).
  - My automated CLI tool (`axe-core-cli`) has shown inconsistencies in
    detecting colors for dynamically themed content, sometimes reporting
    contrast issues for links that appear correct in a live browser. I
    understand this to be a limitation of testing pre-hydration or
    early-hydration states of a themed application with this specific CLI tool.
- **Image Alternatives**: All meaningful images are intended to have descriptive
  alternative text.
- **Button Text**: I am working to ensure all interactive button elements have
  discernible text for screen readers, even if the visual design is iconic.

I am actively working to address any identified shortcomings and improve overall
accessibility. The detailed reports from my automated tools (Axe and Lighthouse
JSON/HTML reports) are saved in the `/accessibility-reports/` directory of my
project repository after running `yarn access`.

## Feedback

I welcome your feedback on the accessibility of Co-Operability.com. Please let
me know if you encounter accessibility barriers:

- **E-mail**: cooperability@gmail.com

I try to respond to feedback within a reasonable timeframe.

## Future Enhancements

I am committed to maintaining and improving the accessibility of my website.
Future plans include:

- Regularly running the `yarn access` script and reviewing all generated reports
  (Axe and Lighthouse).
- Continuously incorporating feedback from users and developers.
- Staying updated on new accessibility best practices and WCAG updates.
- Exploring more advanced automated testing setups (e.g., using browser
  automation like Playwright with Axe-core JS) to more accurately test themed
  states in CI.
