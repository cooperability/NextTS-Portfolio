<ToggleDropdown title="Synthesize Report from Youtube Corpus">
These are full transcripts of long educational lectures on YouTube. Please condense them into a single document as you see fit, prioritizing:

1. A concise summary which synthesizes the corpus' main arguments and rhetorical
   flow. One paragraph per major argument. Central themes and arguments should
   be included; include direct quotes that directly reinforce.
2. Bullet points, as many as you see fit, to enumerate the sub-points of each
   major argument. Also list any "big number" talking points verbatim; stats and
   percentages are useful. Actionable advice or resources referenced should be
   included verbatim among these bullet points, with links if applicable.<br />

- i. Actionable, broadly applicable advice the speaker gives, either explicitly
  or implicitly. If the speaker recommends a course of action, I want to know
  exactly what it is and why it was recommended. <br />
- ii. Include ALL external resources that the speaker references in the summary.
  If the speaker recommends a tool, I want to know exactly what it is and why it
  was recommended.

<ToggleDropdown title="Compose Cover Letter from Source Documents">
**(Requires a job descriptionüü¢, resumeüî¥, and previous cover letterüîµ)**

I have attached documents üü¢, üî¥, and üîµ(names of documents). Write a cover
letter for the job in attachment üü¢, using the contents of resume üî¥ and the
writing style of cover letterüîµ. Don't add any experience that isn't
specifically included in üî¥. Use a
long-short-short-short-long-short-long-short-short sentence structure. Don't be
yappy, but maintain professionalism and emphasize parts of my profile that would
be especially valuable to this company.

<ToggleDropdown title="Compose PRD from Source Codebase">
Based on the code/details here, compose a PRD for this project:

1. The application's purpose, broadly, and how each component contributes. One
   paragraph summary; bullet points for components.
2. The entire tech stack. Bullet points. Outlined & cleanly indented to
   demonstrate frontend, backend, database components. One bullet point/sentence
   per library, framework or piece of tech.
3. The application's complete data schema, including nested projects, database
   models, and inherited types. If possible, include flowcharts for common user
   actions and the data processes they initiate (user clicks button ‚Üí data
   processed ‚Üí response returned, etc)
4. CI/CD and process flow, procedure/protocol details for things like making
   migrations and migrating.

This PRD should have both broad topic coverage and extreme specificity where
possible, as I will use it as a jumping-off point for countless new chats.

<ToggleDropdown title="Summarize this chat as a new prompt">
Distill the insights from this chat into a condensed, organized and informative summary which could be seamlessly appended to this project's documentationüü¢, or used as a new prompt. 
I want to close out this chat without losing time on the errors, technicalities and details we uncovered here with great time and effort.
A data point from this chat should be prioritized for the summary when it is:

1. An insight uncovered through this chat which would be difficult to uncover
   WITHOUT repeating this chat. <br />
2. Prior-posterior beliefs about the system which have changed over the course
   of this chat, yielding a new understanding than when we began. <br />
3. (optional) Changes made to the code within this chat, as well as a short
   explanation for why each change was made. <br />

Do NOT include anything already included in the Documentationüü¢. Again, your
goal is to harvest & append insights that are HIGHLY UNIQUE, USEFUL, SPECIFIC,
and DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER and leave all else behind.

<ToggleDropdown title="Summarize a Book">
**Summarize Book (best with self-help, advice, or knowledge-based books)**

I have uploaded [XY Author]'s [XY Text]. I need an extracted summary from you
containing all actionable advice/knowledge within this text. I will never read
the source text, but I want to enjoy 100% of the academic and experiential
benefits that reading the text confers. Preserve the tone of the original work
as much as possible; do not impose your own tone of any kind. Estimate the time
required for a human to: <br /> 1)read the book, <br /> 2)take notes on it and,
<br /> 3)if applicable, complete any actionable projects within WITHOUT chatGPT
and WITH chatGPT.<br /> Your output should be in markdown, which should be
readable by Anki, GitHub, Next.js posts, etc. Format should be maximally
universal where possible.

The following are tags for the summary:<br /> **PS** = Paraphrased Summary by
LLM<br /> **DQ** = Direct Quotes, VERBATIM excerpts WITH PAGE NUMBER<br />
**CS/IE** = Case Study or Illustrative Example: a story or narrative the text
provides which is intended to evidence a certain argument or point therein.
These should typically be paraphrased and marked with a page number for further
investigation, but occasionally there are **CS/IE**s which can be entirely
contained in a DQ of a few sentences. In these cases DQ is preferable.<br />

Your summary should have the following 4-part structure:

- **Five-paragraph overall summary (PS)**<br />
  - 1 paragraph: intro + roadmap, structure of the text and arguments<br />
  - 3 paragraphs: three major movements from the work demonstrating its segues
    between major arguments, & important subpoints in each argument<br />
  - conclusion, distilled review of overall argument<br />
- **Ten central case studies (CS/IE)s. (PS)**<br />
  - Include less than five sentences per **CS/IE** explaining its
    structure/narrative, showing context in the work, and highlight whether it's
    referenced multiple times.<br />
  - Connect CS/IEs to actionable advice by subpoint if possible<br />
- **Ten bottom-line pieces of concise, actionable advice (DQ preffered, PS
  ok)**<br />
  - whether through author's direct recommendation or implicit illustration e.g.
    "successful/unsuccessful examples have typically included THIS course of
    action: ..."<br />
  - Include sub-bullet **CS/IE** here WHENEVER available<br />
- **Ten of the book's best quotes (DQ), selected on the criteria**:
  - 1. communicates a central point of the text concisely<br />
  - 2. is dramatic, well-written and/or memorable<br />
  - 3. illustrates author's unique perspective/experience well<br />

A few final ABSOLUTE RULES:

1. CLEARLY mark what is (**DQ),** (**PS) and (CS/IE[either DQ or PS])** for all
   bullet points of the summary so as to make the summary properly
   attributable.<br />
2. If uncertain about any part of the reduction/summarization process, ask me
   about specifics instead of assuming any particular behavior.<br />
3. Points which are already too nuanced/concise to be effectively summarized
   should be marked with page numbers so that I can peruse the book. <br />
4. After you complete this first response, give a few options for drilldown
   prompts which would allow me to further investigate the depth of the text
   using your (the LLM's) help.<br />
