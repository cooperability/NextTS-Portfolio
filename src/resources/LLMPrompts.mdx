<ToggleDropdown title="Compose Cover Letter from Source Documents">
**(Requires a job descriptionüü¢, resumeüî¥, and previous cover letterüîµ)**

I have attached documents üü¢, üî¥, and üîµ(names of documents). Write a cover letter for the job in attachment üü¢, using the contents of resume üî¥ and the writing style of cover letterüîµ. Don't add any experience that isn't specifically included in üî¥. Use a long-short-short-short-long-short-long-short-short sentence structure. Please don't be yappy, but maintain professionalism and emphasize parts of my profile that would be especially valuable to this company.

<ToggleDropdown title="Compose PRD from Source Codebase">
Based on the code/details here, compose a PRD for this project:

1. The application's purpose, broadly, and how each component contributes. One paragraph summary; bullet points for components.
2. The entire tech stack. Bullet points. Outlined & cleanly indented to demonstrate frontend, backend, database components. One bullet point/sentence per library, framework or piece of tech.
3. The application's complete data schema, including nested projects, database models, and inherited types. If possible, include flowcharts for common user actions and the data processes they initiate (user clicks button ‚Üí data processed ‚Üí response returned, etc)
4. CI/CD and process flow, procedure/protocol details for things like making migrations and migrating.

This PRD should have both broad topic coverage and extreme specificity where possible, as I will use it as a jumping-off point for countless new chats.

<ToggleDropdown title="Summarize this chat as a new prompt">
Distill the insights from this chat into a condensed, organized and informative summary which could be seamlessly appended to this project's documentationüü¢. A data point from this chat should be prioritized for the summary when it is:

A) An insight uncovered through this chat which would be difficult to uncover WITHOUT repeating this chat.
B) Prior-posterior beliefs about the system which have changed over the course of this chat, yielding a new understanding than when we began.
C) (optional) Changes made to the code within this chat, as well as a short explanation for why each change was made.

Do NOT include anything already included in the Documentationüü¢. Again, your goal is to harvest insights that are HIGHLY UNIQUE, USEFUL, SPECIFIC, and DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER and leave all else behind.

<ToggleDropdown title="Summarize a Book">
**Summarize Book (best with self-help, advice, or knowledge-based books)**

I have uploaded [XY Author]'s [XY Text]. I need an extracted summary from you containing all actionable advice/knowledge within this text.
I will never read the source text, but I want to enjoy 100% of the academic, social, and experiential benefits the text confers.
Preserve the tone of the original work as much as possible; do not impose your own tone of any kind.
At the end of your output, estimate the time required for a human to 1)read the book, 2)take notes on it and 3)complete any actionable projects within WITHOUT chatGPT and WITH chatGPT.
Your output should be in markdown, which should be readable by Anki, GitHub, Next.js posts, etc. Format should be maximally universal where possible.

The following are tags for the summary:
**PS** = Paraphrased Summary by LLM
**DQ** = Direct Quotes, VERBATIM excerpts WITH PAGE NUMBER
**CS/IE** = Case Study or Illustrative Example: a story or narrative the text provides which is intended to evidence a certain argument or point therein. These should typically be paraphrased and marked with a page number for further investigation, but occasionally there are **CS/IE**s which can be entirely contained in a DQ of a few sentences. In these cases DQ is preferable.

Your summary should have the following 4-part structure:

- **Five-paragraph overall summary (PS)**
  -- 1 paragraph: intro + roadmap, structure of the text and arguments
  -- 3 paragraphs: three major movements from the work demonstrating its segues between major arguments, & important subpoints in each argument
  -- conclusion, distilled review of overall argument
- **Ten central case studies (CS/IE)s. (PS)**
  -- Include less than five sentences per **CS/IE** explaining its structure/narrative, showing context in the work, and highlight whether it's referenced multiple times.
  -- Connect CS/IEs to actionable advice by subpoint if possible
- **Ten bottom-line pieces of concise, actionable advice (DQ preffered, PS ok)**
  -- whether through author's direct recommendation or implicit illustration e.g. "successful/unsuccessful examples have typically included THIS course of action: ..."
  -- Include sub-bullet **CS/IE** here WHENEVER available
- **Ten of the book's best quotes (DQ), selected on the criteria**:
  -- 1. communicates a central point of the text concisely
  -- 2. is dramatic, well-written and/or memorable
  -- 3. illustrates author's unique perspective/experience well

A few final ABSOLUTE RULES: 1. CLEARLY mark what is (**DQ),** (**PS) and (CS/IE[either DQ or PS])** for all bullet points of the summary so as to make the summary properly attributable. 2. If uncertain about any part of the reduction/summarization process, ask me about specific implementations instead of assuming any particular behavior. This includes what content/themes/chapters to focus the summary on. 3. Points which are already too nuanced/concise to be effectively summarized should be marked with page numbers so that I can peruse the book. 4. After you complete this first response, give a few options for drilldown prompts which would allow me to further investigate the depth of the text using your (the LLM's) help.
