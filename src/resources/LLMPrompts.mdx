<ToggleDropdown title="Format output for Google Docs">
**Objective:** Generate a response formatted as a clean, hierarchical outline, optimized for direct copy-pasting into Google Docs. The ENTIRE response containing the outline must be delivered within a single, unstyled, copyable text block.

**Formatting Guidelines (within the copyable text block):**

1.  **Structure & Headings:**

    - Employ a clear hierarchical outline structure.
    - **Major Section Headings (e.g., "I. Main Section", "II. Another Main
      Section"):**
      - These should NOT be bullet-pointed.
      - They should sit at the actual left margin of the text block.
      - Use bold text for these main headings.
    - **Sub-Section Headings (e.g., "A. Subsection", "B. Subsection"):**
      - These should also NOT be bullet-pointed.
      - They should be indented one level from the Major Section Headings.
      - Use standard weight text (not bold) for these.

2.  **Bullet Points:**

    - All content under Sub-Section Headings (or directly under Major Section
      Headings if there are no sub-sections for that point) should be bullet
      points.
    - Use a single, consistent bullet character (e.g., a hyphen `-` or an
      asterisk `*`) for all bullet points.
    - Indent bullet points appropriately based on their level in the hierarchy
      (e.g., first-level bullets indented under Sub-Section Headings,
      second-level bullets further indented under first-level bullets).
    - **Crucially for wrapping:** When a bullet point's text wraps to a new
      line, that new line should visually align with the _start of the text_ of
      the bullet point on the line above, NOT with the bullet character itself
      or the far-left margin of the document. (Achieve this by ensuring the LLM
      continues the paragraph naturally with appropriate indentation for the
      list level).

3.  **Text Styling (Minimalist Approach - within the copyable block):**

    - **NO Markdown Syntax:** Avoid all markdown-specific syntax (e.g., `#` for
      headers, `_` for italics, `---` for horizontal rules, backticks for inline
      code).
    - **NO Text Decoration, Coloring, or Highlighting.** The text block should
      be plain.
    - **Bold:** Use bold text _only_ for the Major Section Headings as specified
      above.

4.  **Spacing and Readability (within the copyable text block):**
    - Use single, clean line breaks between headings, sub-headings, and list
      items.
    - Avoid excessive blank lines.

**Output Requirement:**

- The entire outline must be contained within one single copyable text block.
- The text within this block must adhere strictly to the formatting guidelines
  above. The visual structure should make it easy to apply Google Docs' own
  heading and list styles manually if desired after pasting.

**Example of Desired Output Structure (Conceptual for wrapping):**

**I. Main Section Heading One** A. Sub-Section Heading - This is a first-level
bullet point. If this bullet point is long enough to wrap onto a second line,
this second line should align here, under the 'T' of 'This'. - Another
first-level bullet point. - This is a nested, second-level bullet. Its wrapped
lines should align under the 'T' of 'This' in its own first line.

**II. Main Section Heading Two** B. Another Sub-Section Heading - A bullet point
here.

# Project Context & Personality

You are an expert full-stack developer working on a Next.js TypeScript portfolio
project. This is a production-quality codebase with high standards for code
quality, accessibility, and performance.

# Core Principles

- Always prioritize working, running code over perfect code
- Diagnose root causes before suggesting fixes
- Suggest dependency installation when modules are missing
- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- Ask for confirmation on potentially destructive operations

# Project-Specific Guidelines

## Shell & Environment

- Always use Git Bash for terminal commands (not PowerShell or cmd)
- Ensure yarn is installed globally before running package management commands

## Dependencies & Setup

- Use yarn (yarn.lock exists) for package management
- Always check if node_modules exists before suggesting code fixes
- Common commands: `yarn install`, `yarn dev`, `yarn build`, `yarn typecheck`
- Suggest running these commands when encountering module resolution errors

## Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled - address all type errors
- ESLint + Prettier configured - follow existing formatting
- React 19+ with Next.js 15+ - use modern patterns
- Tailwind CSS + CSS modules for styling
- MDX for content with custom components

## Architecture Patterns

- Pages in src/pages/ (Pages Router, not App Router)
- Components in src/components/ with TypeScript interfaces
- Utilities in src/lib/
- Global styles in src/styles/
- Static assets in public/

## Development Workflow

1. First check if dependencies are installed (`ls node_modules` or similar)
2. Run `yarn typecheck` to identify TypeScript issues
3. Use `yarn dev` to test changes locally
4. Lint with `yarn lint` before suggesting code complete

## When to Ask vs. Act

ASK before:

- Installing/upgrading dependencies
- Modifying package.json scripts
- Deleting files or folders
- Making breaking changes to public APIs

ACT immediately for:

- Fixing TypeScript errors in existing code
- Adding missing imports
- Correcting syntax errors
- Formatting code to match existing style

## Error Diagnosis Priority

1. Missing dependencies (suggest yarn install)
2. Missing files (check if they exist elsewhere)
3. TypeScript configuration issues
4. Import/export mismatches
5. Runtime errors

# Response Style

- Lead with the root cause diagnosis
- Provide specific, actionable solutions
- Include relevant file paths and line numbers
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT to change
- Offer to verify fixes worked after implementation

<ToggleDropdown title="Synthesize Report from Long Transcript">
These are full transcripts of a long lecture.
Please condense and summarize them into a single document with the following structure:

1. A concise summary which synthesizes the corpus' main arguments and rhetorical
   flow. One paragraph per major argument. Central themes and arguments should
   be included; include direct quotes that directly reinforce.
2. Bullet points, as many as you see fit, to enumerate the sub-points of each
   major argument. Also list any "big number" talking points verbatim; stats and
   percentages are useful. Actionable advice or resources referenced should be
   included verbatim among these bullet points, with links if applicable.<br />

The summary can be composed at your discretion in order to capture both its main
arguments and rhetorical flow, but must include verbatim quotes from the
transcript when the transcript mentions:

- i. Actionable, applicable advice the speaker gives, explicitly or implicitly.
  If the speaker recommends a course of action, I want to know exactly what and
  why. <br />
- ii. ANY external resource or tool that the speaker references or recommends,
  and rationale for why it was recommended.<br />
- iii. Some of this course material will be old, so if your training set
  includes more recent material, you should use that instead.

<ToggleDropdown title="Generate Product-Market Research">

Act as a product manager, browse the web, and perform market research in the
[enter your niche] niche as well as the specific [vertical] vertical.

**Give me:**

- Global market size and growth projections
- Key players and their market share
- Industry trends and technologies
- SWOT analysis
- Customer needs and pain points
- Competitive advantages and USPs
- Market segmentation and target audience
- Marketing and sales strategies
- Regulatory and legal considerations
- A score for how easy it is to enter the market, plus rationale
- A list of potential MVPs, with a pseudo-PRD for each

<ToggleDropdown title="Compose PRD from Source Codebase">
Based on the code/details here, compose a PRD for this project:

1. The application's purpose, broadly, and how each component contributes. One
   paragraph summary; bullet points for components.
2. The entire tech stack. Bullet points. Outlined & cleanly indented to
   demonstrate frontend, backend, database components. One bullet point/sentence
   per library, framework or piece of tech.
3. The application's complete data schema, including nested projects, database
   models, and inherited types. If possible, include flowcharts for common user
   actions and the data processes they initiate (user clicks button ‚Üí data
   processed ‚Üí response returned, etc)
4. CI/CD and process flow, procedure/protocol details for things like making
   migrations and migrating.

This PRD should have both broad topic coverage and extreme specificity where
possible, as I will use it as a jumping-off point for countless new chats.

<ToggleDropdown title="Summarize this chat as a new prompt">

Distill the insights from this chat into a condensed, organized and informative
summary which could be seamlessly appended to this project's documentationüü¢, or
used as a new prompt. I want to close out this chat without losing time on the
errors, technicalities and details we uncovered here with great time and effort.
A data point from this chat should be prioritized for the summary when it is:

1. An insight uncovered through this chat which would be difficult to uncover
   WITHOUT repeating this chat. <br />
2. Prior-posterior beliefs about the system which have changed over the course
   of this chat, yielding a new understanding than when we began. <br />
3. (optional) Changes made to the code within this chat, as well as a short
   explanation for why each change was made. <br />

Do NOT include anything already included in the Documentationüü¢. Again, your
goal is to harvest & append insights that are HIGHLY UNIQUE, USEFUL, SPECIFIC,
and DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER and leave all else behind.

I would love two analyses:<br />

1. One that's strictly bullet points explaining what we achieved here, including
   all design constraints or otherwise optimizations uncovered. X or fewer
   points. <br />
2. One that's two paragraphs logically explaining the same (what we did here),
   but with greater attention to detail and nuance with justifications for
   design decisions. Y paragraphs or less.

<ToggleDropdown title="Summarize a Book">
**Summarize Book (best with self-help, advice, or knowledge-based books.**

I have uploaded [XY Author]'s [XY Text]. I need an extracted summary from you
containing all actionable advice/knowledge within this text. I will never read
the source text, but I want to enjoy 100% of the academic and experiential
benefits that reading the text confers. Preserve the tone of the original work
as much as possible; do not impose your own tone of any kind. Estimate the time
required for a human to: <br /> 1.read the book, <br /> 2.take notes on it
and,<br /> 3.if applicable, complete any actionable projects within WITHOUT
chatGPT and WITH chatGPT.<br /> Your output should be in markdown, which should
be readable by Anki, GitHub, Next.js posts, etc. Format should be maximally
universal where possible.

The following are tags for the summary:<br /> **PS** = Paraphrased Summary by
LLM<br /> **DQ** = Direct Quotes, VERBATIM excerpts WITH PAGE NUMBER<br />
**CS/IE** = Case Study or Illustrative Example: a story or narrative the text
provides which is intended to evidence a certain argument or point therein.
These should typically be paraphrased and marked with a page number for further
investigation, but occasionally there are **CS/IE**s which can be entirely
contained in a DQ of a few sentences. In these cases DQ is preferable.<br />

Your summary should have the following 4-part structure:

- **Five-paragraph overall summary (PS)**<br />
  - 1 paragraph: intro + roadmap, structure of the text and arguments<br />
  - 3 paragraphs: three major movements from the work demonstrating its segues
    between major arguments, & important subpoints in each argument<br />
  - conclusion, distilled review of overall argument<br />
- **Ten central case studies (CS/IE)s. (PS)**<br />
  - Include less than five sentences per **CS/IE** explaining its
    structure/narrative, showing context in the work, and highlight whether it's
    referenced multiple times.<br />
  - Connect CS/IEs to actionable advice by subpoint if possible<br />
- **Ten bottom-line pieces of concise, actionable advice (DQ preffered, PS
  ok)**<br />
  - whether through author's direct recommendation or implicit illustration e.g.
    "successful/unsuccessful examples have typically included THIS course of
    action: ..."<br />
  - Include sub-bullet **CS/IE** here WHENEVER available<br />
- **Ten of the book's best quotes (DQ), selected on the criteria**:
  - 1. communicates a central point of the text concisely<br />
  - 2. is dramatic, well-written and/or memorable<br />
  - 3. illustrates author's unique perspective/experience well<br />

A few final ABSOLUTE RULES:

1. CLEARLY mark what is (**DQ),** (**PS) and (CS/IE[either DQ or PS])** for all
   bullet points of the summary so as to make the summary properly
   attributable.<br />
2. If uncertain about any part of the reduction/summarization process, ask me
   about specifics instead of assuming any particular behavior.<br />
3. Points which are already too nuanced/concise to be effectively summarized
   should be marked with page numbers so that I can peruse the book. <br />
4. After you complete this first response, give a few options for drilldown
   prompts which would allow me to further investigate the depth of the text
   using your (the LLM's) help.<br />
