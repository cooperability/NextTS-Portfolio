# Privacy Statement

I believe in transparent, responsible data handling. This website uses Vercel
Analytics to understand traffic patterns and improve user experience—it's
privacy-forward by design, focusing on aggregated, anonymous data without
cookies or cross-site tracking. I also use Google Search Console to monitor
search performance and optimize content visibility, though it doesn't place any
tracking scripts on this site.

This approach gives me the insights I need to maintain and improve the website
while respecting your privacy. I've intentionally chosen tools that don't build
detailed user profiles or require complex consent mechanisms. If you're browsing
with Safari's Advanced Tracking Protection and see a warning message, that's
just Safari being extra cautious—the analytics here are genuinely non-invasive.

**What I've implemented:**
- Privacy-forward Vercel Analytics (no cookies, anonymized data)
- Google Search Console integration for search performance
- HTTPS security and mobile-responsive design
- 301 redirects from old URLs to maintain SEO without broken links
- Current XML sitemap submission

Safari users may occasionally see privacy warnings due to the browser's strict
heuristics, but this reflects Safari's sensitivity rather than invasive tracking
on my part.
