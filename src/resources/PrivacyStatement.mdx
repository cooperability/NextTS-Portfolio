# Privacy Statement & SEO Approach

I use Vercel Analytics to understand website traffic and improve user
experience. Vercel Analytics is privacy-forward. It focuses on aggregated,
anonymous data (page views, unique visitors, top pages, referrers, performance
metrics) and does not use cookies by default to track individual users or build
detailed user profiles across sites. Its aim is to provide valuable insights
without the more invasive tracking methods that trigger stricter consent
requirements under laws like GDPR.

I use Google Search Console to understand how my site performs in Google search
results, identify indexing issues, and optimize my content for better
visibility. Google Search Console does not place tracking scripts on this
website; it uses Google's own search data.

This dual approach allows me to gather essential performance and SEO data while
prioritizing your privacy. I believe in transparency and responsible data
handling.

## My SEO & Content Strategy: A Checklist

My primary SEO goal is to ensure `cooperability.com` and content related to
"Cooper Reed" ranks effectively for relevant searches. I follow these practices:

- **[ ] Google Search Console (GSC) Integration:**
  - Set up GSC to monitor search performance and indexing.
  - Submit an XML sitemap to GSC (see guide below).
- **Meta Descriptions:** Crafting compelling meta descriptions for search
  results.
- **Header Tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.):** Using header tags hierarchically to
  structure content. `<h1>` tags are present on main pages, sometimes visually
  hidden for a cleaner design while remaining accessible to screen readers and
  search engines.
- **Image Alt Text:** Describing images accurately for accessibility and SEO.
- **[âœ“] Technical SEO:**
  - **HTTPS:** Site served securely over HTTPS (standard with Vercel).
  - **Mobile-Friendliness:** Ensuring a responsive design for all devices.
  - **Site Speed:** Optimizing load times (monitored via Vercel Speed Insights &
    GSC).
  - **301 Redirects for Old URLs:** Implemented permanent redirects (301s) in
    `next.config.js` to guide search engines from old paths (like `/skills` and
    `/prompts`) to their new locations (`/demos` and `/resources`). This
    resolves outdated links appearing in search results and consolidates SEO
    value.
- **[ ] Content Strategy for Target Keywords:**
  - Naturally incorporating "Cooper Reed" and "cooperability.com" in relevant
    site content, especially the homepage, about sections, and contact
    information.
  - Creating content that aligns with user search intent for these terms.
- **[ ] Internal Linking:**
  - Strategically linking between relevant pages on the site to improve
    navigation and distribute link equity.
- **[ ] Regular Audits & Updates:**
  - Periodically reviewing GSC data for issues and opportunities.
  - Keeping content fresh and up-to-date.

_(This checklist will be updated as tasks are completed.)_

## Addressing Outdated Search Result Listings

You might have previously seen pages from this site listed in Google search
results with "Untitled" as their title, or under old paths like `/skills` or
`/prompts`. This occurred because:

1.  The `<title>` tags on those pages were not optimally set when Google first
    indexed them.
2.  The site structure was updated, and pages moved (e.g., from `/skills` to
    `/demos`).

**Solution Implemented:**

- **Correct Page Titles:** All current pages now have accurate and descriptive
  `<title>` tags.
- **Permanent Redirects (301s):** I've configured 301 redirects in the site's
  `next.config.js`. This tells search engines that the old URLs have permanently
  moved to the new ones. For example, requests to `/skills` are now
  automatically and permanently redirected to `/demos`.
- **Sitemap & Google Search Console:** An up-to-date sitemap has been generated
  and submitted to Google Search Console, listing only the correct, current
  URLs.

It will take some time for Google to recrawl the site and fully update its index
to reflect these changes. This is a standard part of website maintenance and
SEO.

## Quick Guide: Setting Up Google Search Console (GSC)

For future reference, or if I need to re-verify, here's a condensed guide:

1.  **Access GSC:** Go to
    [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and sign
    in with your Google account.
2.  **Add Property:**
    - Click "Add property" (usually top-left dropdown).
    - Select "Domain" property type (recommended).
    - Enter `cooperability.com` and click "Continue".
3.  **Verify Ownership (DNS TXT Record):**
    - GSC will provide a TXT record value (e.g.,
      `google-site-verification=...`).
    - Copy this value.
    - Log in to your domain registrar (where you bought `cooperability.com`).
    - Navigate to DNS management settings for `cooperability.com`.
    - Add a new TXT record: Host/Name: `@` (or leave blank, depending on
      registrar), Value/Content: Paste the TXT record from GSC.
    - Save the DNS record. DNS changes can take time to propagate (minutes to
      hours).
    - Return to GSC and click "Verify". If it fails, wait a bit longer for DNS
      propagation and try again.
4.  **Submit Sitemap:**
    - Once verified, select your property in GSC.
    - Go to "Sitemaps" (left menu).
    - Under "Add a new sitemap," enter `sitemap.xml` (GSC will prefix it with
      your domain).
    - Click "Submit".
    - Monitor the status in GSC over the next few days.

## Why This Approach?

My strategy is to build a strong organic search presence through best practices
in content creation and technical SEO, while respecting user privacy. By using
Vercel Analytics and Google Search Console, I gain the insights needed to
improve and grow, without resorting to more intrusive user tracking methods that
would necessitate complex consent mechanisms. This means a better, safer
experience for users, and a focused, effective strategy for my site.

## A Note on Safari's Advanced Tracking Protection

Users browsing with Safari on certain Apple devices (particularly iPhones) with
"Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection" enabled might occasionally see
a browser-generated message stating: _"If this page is not displaying as
expected, you can reduce advanced privacy protections which may resolve
issues."_

This is a generic warning from Safari due to its highly sensitive heuristics for
detecting any form of data transmission that _could potentially_ be used for
tracking, even if the analytics employed are designed to be privacy-respecting.

**cooperability.com uses Vercel Analytics and Vercel Speed Insights, which are
privacy-focused:**

- They **do not use cookies** for tracking.
- User data is **anonymized** and aggregated.
- Individual users are **not tracked** across different websites or
  applications.
- Visitor identifiers are temporary (hashed from the incoming request and
  discarded after 24 hours).

I believe this Safari warning, when it appears on this site, is a result of
these strict browser-level heuristics rather than an indication of intrusive
tracking by cooperability.com. I am committed to user privacy and have chosen my
analytics tools accordingly. If you have any concerns, please feel free to
review the details in this Privacy Statement or contact me.
