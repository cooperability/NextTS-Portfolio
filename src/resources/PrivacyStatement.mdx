# Privacy Statement & SEO Approach

This website uses Vercel Analytics to understand website traffic and improve
user experience. Vercel Analytics is designed with privacy in mind. It focuses
on aggregated, anonymous data (page views, unique visitors, top pages,
referrers, performance metrics) and does not use cookies by default to track
individual users or build detailed user profiles across sites. Its aim is to
provide valuable insights without the more invasive tracking methods that
trigger stricter consent requirements under laws like GDPR.

We also leverage Google Search Console to understand how our site performs in
Google search results, identify indexing issues, and optimize our content for
better visibility. Google Search Console does not place tracking scripts on this
website; it uses Google's own search data.

This dual approach allows us to gather essential performance and SEO data while
prioritizing your privacy. We believe in transparency and responsible data
handling.

## Our SEO & Content Strategy: A Checklist

Our primary SEO goal is to ensure `cooperability.com` and content related to
"Cooper Reed" ranks effectively for relevant searches. We follow these
practices:

- **[✓] Foundational Setup:**
  - Using Next.js on Vercel for a performant, SEO-friendly architecture.
  - Implemented Vercel Analytics for privacy-first traffic insights.
- **[ ] Google Search Console (GSC) Integration:**
  - Set up GSC to monitor search performance and indexing.
  - Submit an XML sitemap to GSC (see guide below).
- **[✓] On-Page SEO Fundamentals:**
  - **Content Quality:** Prioritizing high-quality, original content.
  - **Title Tags:** Ensuring unique, descriptive `<title>` tags for each page.
    (e.g., `Demos - Co-Operability`, `Resources - Co-Operability`). The homepage
    title is `Cooper Reed - Portfolio | Co-Operability`.
  - **Meta Descriptions:** Crafting compelling meta descriptions for search
    results. (Ongoing)
  - **Header Tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.):** Using header tags hierarchically to
    structure content. `<h1>` tags are present on main pages, sometimes visually
    hidden for a cleaner design while remaining accessible to screen readers and
    search engines.
  - **Image Alt Text:** Describing images accurately for accessibility and SEO.
    (Ongoing)
- **[✓] Technical SEO:**
  - **HTTPS:** Site served securely over HTTPS (standard with Vercel).
  - **Mobile-Friendliness:** Ensuring a responsive design for all devices.
  - **Site Speed:** Optimizing for fast load times (monitored via Vercel Speed
    Insights & GSC).
  - **301 Redirects for Old URLs:** Implemented permanent redirects (301s) in
    `next.config.js` to guide search engines from old paths (like `/skills` and
    `/prompts`) to their new locations (`/demos` and `/resources`). This
    resolves outdated links appearing in search results and consolidates SEO
    value.
- **[ ] Content Strategy for Target Keywords:**
  - Naturally incorporating "Cooper Reed" and "cooperability.com" in relevant
    site content, especially the homepage, about sections, and contact
    information.
  - Creating content that aligns with user search intent for these terms.
- **[ ] Internal Linking:**
  - Strategically linking between relevant pages on the site to improve
    navigation and distribute link equity.
- **[ ] Regular Audits & Updates:**
  - Periodically reviewing GSC data for issues and opportunities.
  - Keeping content fresh and up-to-date.

## Addressing Outdated Search Result Listings

You might have previously seen pages from this site listed in Google search
results with "Untitled" as their title, or under old paths like `/skills` or
`/prompts`. This occurred because:

1.  The `<title>` tags on those pages were not optimally set when Google first
    indexed them.
2.  The site structure was updated, and pages moved (e.g., from `/skills` to
    `/demos`).

**Solution Implemented:**

- **Correct Page Titles:** All current pages now have accurate and descriptive
  `<title>` tags.
- **Permanent Redirects (301s):** We've configured 301 redirects in our
  `next.config.js`. This tells search engines that the old URLs have permanently
  moved to the new ones. For example, requests to `/skills` are now
  automatically and permanently redirected to `/demos`.
- **Sitemap & Google Search Console:** An up-to-date sitemap will be submitted
  to Google Search Console, listing only the correct, current URLs.

It will take some time for Google to recrawl the site and fully update its index
to reflect these changes. This is a standard part of website maintenance and
SEO.

## Quick Guide: Setting Up Google Search Console (GSC)

For future reference, or if you need to re-verify, here's a condensed guide:

1.  **Access GSC:** Go to
    [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and sign
    in with your Google account.
2.  **Add Property:**
    - Click "Add property" (usually top-left dropdown).
    - Select "Domain" property type (recommended).
    - Enter `cooperability.com` and click "Continue".
3.  **Verify Ownership (DNS TXT Record):**
    - GSC will provide a TXT record value (e.g.,
      `google-site-verification=...`).
    - Copy this value.
    - Log in to your domain registrar (where you bought `cooperability.com`).
    - Navigate to DNS management settings for `cooperability.com`.
    - Add a new TXT record: Host/Name: `@` (or leave blank, depending on
      registrar), Value/Content: Paste the TXT record from GSC.
    - Save the DNS record. DNS changes can take time to propagate (minutes to
      hours).
    - Return to GSC and click "Verify". If it fails, wait a bit longer for DNS
      propagation and try again.
4.  **Submit Sitemap:**
    - Once verified, select your property in GSC.
    - Go to "Sitemaps" (left menu).
    - Under "Add a new sitemap," enter `sitemap.xml` (GSC will prefix it with
      your domain).
    - Click "Submit".
    - Monitor the status in GSC over the next few days.

## Why This Approach?

Our strategy is to build a strong organic search presence through best practices
in content creation and technical SEO, while respecting user privacy. By using
Vercel Analytics and Google Search Console, we gain the insights needed to
improve and grow, without resorting to more intrusive user tracking methods that
would necessitate complex consent mechanisms. This means a better, safer
experience for you, and a focused, effective strategy for us.
